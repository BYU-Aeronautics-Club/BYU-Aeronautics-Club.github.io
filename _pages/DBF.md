Within the Aeronautics Clubs we currently have one official team: The AIAA Design Build Fly Team that associated with the annual [AIAA Design Build Fly Competion](https://www.aiaa.org/dbf).  The team github can be found at [github.com/BYU-Aeronautics-Club/DBF](https://github.com/BYU-Aeronautics-Club/DBF).

For the team's quick reference, we have started to compile various tips, tricks, and helpful hints available here.
