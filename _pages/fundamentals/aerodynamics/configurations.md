As a general class of aircraft, a UAV can be just about any flying vehicle that does not contain a person. In the Aeronautics Club, we deal primarily with fixed-wing UAV's, which generate lift through aerodynamic forces using the shape of the aircraft itself. Although you may be most comfortable with the conventional aircraft design, there are many fixed-wing configurations worth exploring that can produce desirable characteristics. Selections should be made based on your mission and performance requirements. Here we present a non-exhaustive list of some alternatives for wing, engine, and tail designs.

## Wings
We will first discuss the conventional wing configuration mentioned above. It features a single, forward wing paired with a tail toward the back of the UAV. Since the wing generates most of the lift, it creates a slight moment around the center of gravity (CG). The tail is placed at the back of the UAV to offset the aerodynamic moment from the wing, making it statically stable.
