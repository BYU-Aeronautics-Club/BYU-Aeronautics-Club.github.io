As a general class of aircraft, a UAV can be just about any flying vehicle that does not contain a person. In the Aeronautics Club, we deal primarily with fixed-wing UAV's, which generate lift through aerodynamic forces using the shape of the aircraft itself. Although you may be most comfortable with the conventional aircraft design, there are many fixed-wing configurations worth exploring that can produce desirable characteristics. Selections should be made based on your mission and performance requirements. Here we present a non-exhaustive list of some alternatives for wing, engine, and tail designs.

## Aircraft Geometry

## Wings
We will first discuss the conventional wing configuration mentioned above. It features a single, forward wing paired with a tail toward the back of the UAV. Since the wing generates most of the lift, it creates a slight moment around the center of gravity (CG). The tail is placed at the back of the UAV to offset the aerodynamic moment from the wing, making it statically stable. A conventional wing is very stable and easy to work with. This is a good choice when a project has limited design time or expertise are limited. It is by far the most commonly used configuration, and for good reason. There is some lack of flexibility if you have a unique mission requirement that needs some additional creativity in design, or want to pursue a more interesting design path.

Another common configuration for small UAV's is the flying wing. Unlike other common designs, the flying wing has no tail. The stability is instead provided by a highly swept wing, typically with vertial stabilizers on the ends. Popular examples of this are the [B-2 Stealth Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit "B-2 Bomber") and the updated [B-21 Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-21_Raider "B-21 Raider"). One of the main advantages of the flying wing is the high acrobatic ability and maneuvarability. This can be attributed to its lower stability due to the lack of tail. The lowered stability makes it difficult to control, especially for a new pilot without a lot of flying experience. Although difficult to design, it can be a lot of fun to fly.

The biplane configuration, although not very common, has the advantage of providing large amounts of lift with a relatively small span. This can be advantageous for a project where a smaller span is a design requirement. The tradeoff, however, is decreased aerodynamic efficiency. This is largely due to the interaction between the two wing surfaces. The lower wing receives downwash from the upper wing, infringing its ability to generate lift. In addition, splitting the wing into two pieces will increase the surface area needed to create the same amount of lift, greatly increasing the drag on the UAV.

Some flexibility in the longitudinal positioning of the wing is offered in the canard configuration. It features a wing placed at the rear of the UAV with a horizontal stabilizer at the front. This is common on business-class jets such as the [Piaggio P180](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaggio_P.180_Avanti "Piaggio P180") because it allows the engines to be mounted in the rear to reduce noise in the cabin. Since the wing is far aft of the center of gravity, the horizontal stabilizer is placed in front to provide static stability. This could be useful in a situation where greater access to the fuselage is needed or rear motor placement is necessary. The drawback is the increased complexity in the aerodynamic design that would likely result in a less stable configuration for a small UAV.

The last wing configuration we will mention is the tandem, which merely replaces the tail with a second wing. Much like the biplane, this allows for a UAV that has a much shorter span that produces the same amount of lift. Also like the biplane, the aft wing will receive downwash from the front wing, reducing aerodynamic efficiency. Some common applications in industry are small, personal aircraft and long distance flyers.
