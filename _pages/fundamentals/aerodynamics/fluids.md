In order to begin to understand the complexities of designing a small UAV, it is important to first have some grasp of the fundamentals of the fluid (air) within which they operate. This page is a short guide to the most relevant principles, and is not meant to be a reference or comprehensive source for understanding fluid mechanics. It can, however, be a great starting point for understanding important concepts. These concepts will help you to have a basic idea of what is really going on in flight and to develop your own intuition for making design decisions throughout your project.
