The way you design your UAV will be largely driven by the mission and design requirements you defined at the outset of your project. Depending on the mission, there are a large variety of aircraft that could be designed to fulfill your mission. However, there are some universal principles of flight that will be essential in determining the feasibility of your UAV. As you refine your design using these principles, your UAV will improve in its ability to perform as an aircraft and fulfill its mission.
