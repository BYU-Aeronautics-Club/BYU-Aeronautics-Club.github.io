The way you design your UAV will be largely driven by the mission and design requirements you defined at the outset of your project. Depending on the mission, there are a large variety of aircraft that could be designed to fulfill your mission. However, there are some universal principles of flight that will be essential in determining the feasibility of your UAV. As you refine your design using these principles, your UAV will improve in its ability to perform as an aircraft and fulfill its mission.

## Measures of Aerodynamic Performance
### Lifting Capability
The most basic way to determine if your UAV is airworthy is to determine if it can produce sufficient lift to overcome gravity. You may have noticed there isn't really a section anywhere on lift on this site. This is because compared to drag, lift is incredibly simple. Here, we simply need to look at the *stall speed* of your aircraft. The stall speed is defined as the minimum speed required to maintain altitude at maximum lift. It is related to the [C<sub>l</sub> max](https://aeronautics.byu.edu/fundamentals/aerodynamics/airfoils/#lift-and-drag-performance) of the airfoil, as in the formula below (taken from the definition of coefficient of lift).

Notice the effect that span also has on the stall speed. A stall speed of about 10-12 m/s is typical for a small UAV, but minimizing this will allow you to lower your power requirements, which in turn saves weight (and money). If you get much higher than about 15 m/s you will want to seriously consider redesigning some aspects of your UAV or you may not be able to achieve flight.
