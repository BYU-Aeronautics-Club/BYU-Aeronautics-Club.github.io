As a general class of aircraft, a UAV can be just about any flying vehicle that does not contain a person. In the Aeronautics Club, we deal primarily with fixed-wing UAV's, which generate lift through aerodynamic forces using the shape of the aircraft itself. This is in contrast to a rotor-wing UAV (such as a quadcopter), which generates lift using a thrust vector. The main lifting surfaces that generate the lift on a fixed-wing UAV are the wing and tail. Although you may be most comfortable with the conventional aircraft design (single forward wing and t-shaped tail), there are advantages to exploring a number of different configurations and designs.
