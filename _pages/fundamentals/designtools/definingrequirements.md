Whether or not you know it, the UAV you are planning to build right now has a specific mission it needs to fulfill. For many beginners, this can be as simple as having the capability to take off, fly for 5 minutes, and then land. Perhaps you want to lift a payload or achieve a certain speed. In any case, it is essential to be able to determine the *mission requirements* of your specific UAV project before even thinking about design. Doing so properly will serve to drive your project from start to finish.

## Mission Requirements
Before defining what your mission requirements are, you will need to first think about what is you want your UAV to do. This should be very specific. As an example, we'll say you want to build a UAV that can carry a small package of candy to your friend that lives two blocks away. You might define the following as your mission requirements:

+ Payload capacity of 100g
+ 10 minute flight time
+ Capable of flying without line of sight (LOS)
+ Capable of dropping payload remotely and accurately
+ Fixed-wing configuration
+ Hand launchable
+ Costs under $100 to make

These mission requirements should be top priority
