Most classes you've taken up to this point have probably neglected the importance of iterative prototyping. Usually due to lack of time, you probably ended up just making one final prototype for whatever project you were working on. Prototyping for a full UAV design project should be much more intensive and thorough to ensure your UAV can reasonably fulfill its mission. This page will step you through a standard approach to prototyping.

## Conceptual Prototyping
As you begin designing your UAV, there will likely be a few different configurations and system models that you'll be considering. During the conceptual stage, one of the most important things to do is to begin creating a CAD model using a software package such as Solidworks&#x00AE;. This will help you to visualize how all of the different components fit together from each system. Some basic physical models using posterboard or cardboard may also be useful for doing a quick physical prototype.

Once you have a general idea of what your UAV is going to look like, you will want to start thinking about what materials and processes to use for your final build. One way to do this is to create a manufacturing plan (see Figure 1). A manufacturing plan is a general outline of the procedures you plan on going through to
