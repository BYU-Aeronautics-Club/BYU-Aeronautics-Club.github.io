One of the most critical parts of your design project is the testing you will be conducting to ensure it is airworthy and performing as expected. This is done through a number of tests both on the ground and in the air. You will want to test components, aerodynamics, propulsion, and the complete UAV. It is important to have an objective in mind with any test you conduct so the results can inform any design changes you might need to make. When done in tandem with [prototyping](https://aeronautics.byu.edu/fundamentals/designtools/prototyping/), testing can be an immensely useful tool during your design project.
